During my first year at wright state and in the cybersecurity and IT program, i took intro to programming 
where we coded alot.One project we made a program that was used for customers who wanted to know how much 
it would cost to fertilize their yard, but what i did not realize is that anyone could use the program without 
the code authorizing you which is a CWE. Missing authorization is in the top 25. Missing authorization is
when the software does not check who is using the software or if they are even allowed to use it.

Actually in most of my early programs I did not use authorization and probably should have done so.
It would of made it more secure and also made it more professional. I could have fixed this in 
the given code by adding a customer name and telling the customer to state who they are to authorize
them and decline whoever is not authorized. This would of helped the integrity of my program and 
eliminate a vulnerability.

Example of a CVE is using services that are a common attack point. What this means is 
attackers will look to see which services are being used the most or that has the most
traffic and will target this service to effect the most possible users they can. Or if
there is a certain user they are trying to target, they can focus on the service they use often
or the most and will have the best chance at successfully attacking that certain user.
